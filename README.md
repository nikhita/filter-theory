# Basic Filter Theory implementation in Scilab

## Current Work

This repo contains the implementation of the following in Scilab:

1. Magnitude and Phase response
2. Linear convolution
3. Circular convolution
4. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)
5. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design [WIP]

## Development

This repo was made as a quick hack to study for my semester exam. However, I intend on doing the following too:

1. Refractor the code
2. Add sample inputs and outputs
3. Add screenshots of graph plots
4. Add theory and implementation details (possibly a blog post).
